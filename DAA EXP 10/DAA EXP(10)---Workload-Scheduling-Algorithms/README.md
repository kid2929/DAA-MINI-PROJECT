# DAA-MINI-PROJECT: Workload Scheduling Algorithms

## Introduction
This project implements various workload scheduling algorithms to demonstrate their performance and efficiency. The algorithms included are:
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the fundamental concepts of CPU scheduling.
- To analyze the performance of different scheduling algorithms under varied workloads.
- To implement and compare the algorithms in Python.

## Features
- Interactive user interface for inputting process burst times and priorities.
- Calculation of waiting times and turnaround times for each process.
- Average waiting time and turnaround time computation.
- Clear output format for easy interpretation of results.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: The process with the smallest burst time is executed next.
3. **Priority Scheduling**: Each process is assigned a priority; the process with the highest priority is executed first.
4. **Round Robin**: Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) and is cycled through until all processes are complete.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can clone the repository and run the scheduling algorithms as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DAA-MINI-PROJECT.git
cd DAA-MINI-PROJECT
```

## Usage
To run any of the scheduling algorithms, execute the corresponding Python file. For example, to run the FCFS algorithm:

```bash
python "FCFS algo.py"
```
